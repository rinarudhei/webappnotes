## **jQuery**
- The set of tools used to allow modification and control of the DOM are a bit of mess because they differ across browsers, generally for historical reasons. To make your job easier, a number of libraries have been created that hide these differences, providing a more uniform way of interacting with the DOM. Often they also provide AJAX functionality, taking the burden of that complexity away from you.

``By the way, the way you interact with the DOM (or any service that you use via code) is called an Application Programming Interface or API.``
