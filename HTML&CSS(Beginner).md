### **Colors:** 16,777,216

### **Values & Units:**
- **px** (such as font-size: 12px) is the unit for pixels.
- **em** (such as font-size: 2em) is the unit for the calculated size of a font. So “2em”, for example, is two times the current font size.
- **pt** (such as font-size: 12pt) is the unit for points, - for measurements typically in printed media.
- **%** (such as width: 80%) is the unit for… wait for it… percentages
- **vw** Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*
- **vh** Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*
- Other units include pc (picas), cm (centimeters), mm (millimeters) and in (inches).

### **Text**
- **font-style** states whether the text is italic or not. It can be font-style: italic or font-style: normal.
- **text-decoration** states whether the text has got a line running under, over, or through it.
  + text-decoration: underline, does what you would expect.
  + text-decoration: overline places a line above the text.
  + text-decoration: line-through puts a line through the text (“strike-through”).

- **text-transform** will change the case of the text.
  - text-transform: capitalize turns the first letter of every word into uppercase.
  - text-transform: uppercase turns everything into uppercase.
  - text-transform: lowercase turns everything into lowercase.
  - text-transform: none I’ll leave for you to work out.
- The **letter-spacing** and **word-spacing** properties are for spacing between letters or words. The value can be a length or normal.

- The **line-height** property sets the height of the lines in an element, such as a paragraph, without adjusting the size of the font. It can be a number (which specifies a multiple of the font size, so “2” will be two times the font size, for example), a length, a percentage, or normal.

- The **text-align** property will align the text inside an element to left, right, center, or justify.

- The **text-indent** property will indent the first line of a paragraph, for example, to a given length or percentage. This is a style traditionally used in print, but rarely in digital media such as the web.

### **Images**
- A JPEG (pronounced “jay-peg”) uses a mathematical algorithm to compress the image and will distort the original slightly. The lower the compression, the higher the file size, but the clearer the image.
  - JPEGs are typically used for images such as photographs.

- A GIF (pronounced “jif”) can have no more than 256 colors, but they maintain the colors of the original image. The lower the number of colors you have in the image, the lower the file size will be. GIFs also allow any pixel in the image to be transparent.
  - GIFs are typically used for images with solid colors, such as icons or logos.

- A PNG (pronounced “ping”) replicates colors, much like a GIF, but allows 16 million colors as well as alpha transparency (that is, an area could be 50% transparent).
  - PNGs are typically used for versatile images in more complex designs BUT they are not fully supported by some older browsers. 
  
### **Form**

- all form tags such as input, select, textarea, etc, needs to be named so they can be handled with some scripts
